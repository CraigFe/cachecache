# gospel-lru

A verified implementation of LRU caches, using the
[Gospel](https://github.com/vocal-project/vocal/) specification language and the
[Why3](http://why3.lri.fr/) verification platform.

**Disclaimer**: this library is still at preliminary stage, and not ready for public
use. Interface and implementation are highly unstable.
